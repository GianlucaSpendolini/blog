title: Welcome to my blog

Jekyll uses a file titled _config.yml to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle. You can check out the _config.yml file on the Code tab of your repository.

We need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named "minima".

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll. In Jekyll, we can create a blog by using specially named files and frontmatter. The files must be named _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md. You must also include title and date in your frontmatter.

What is frontmatter?: The syntax Jekyll files use is called YAML frontmatter
